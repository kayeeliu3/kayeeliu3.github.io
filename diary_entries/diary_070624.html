            Holy shit, I'm actually an idiot and a half. How have I even survived this far?

            <br /><br />
            I can't let things stay like this. I don't want my life to be a constant cycle of things being okay for a little while before collapsing into itself
            again. I want so much to be at peace with myself that I become less at peace. The more useful I wish to be, the more power I place in other people's viewpoints, and the less secure I feel in myself.
            The more at peace I want to be, the less useful I find myself to other people. And I cannot survive in this world without being useful in some way.

            <br /><br /> How can I feel at peace, and yet useful? Am I pursuing the wrong path?
            Is this what I really want to do? What do I even want? How can I survive in a way that makes me somewhat content whilst in a position to pay the bills? Am I even looking at life the right way?
            <br /><br />This site is a mess. I think I'll rewrite it soon. Some day.
