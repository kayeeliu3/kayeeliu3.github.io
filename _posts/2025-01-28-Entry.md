        It begins slowly, without you don't noticing it in any significant capacity yet.<br/><br/>

        Forgetting the placement of your phone. Misremembering a particular event that happened during the holidays.
        Failing to recall why one walked into the kitchen. Easily losing track of the time.<br/><br/>

        Then it becomes a bit clearer. Outbursts may become frequent, important day-to-day information becomes lost,
        and their words become harder to weave into coherent sentences. As much as you try and support them, a part of your
        mind knows - its worsening is inevitable.<br/><br/>

        I hope that I will be able to support them well.<br/><br/>
