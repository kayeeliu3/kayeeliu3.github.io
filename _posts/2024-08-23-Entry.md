        I used to wish, with the entirety of my tiny heart, that I was
        what I was today. To blend into the shadows, to be
        unnoticeable, to be forgettable. Why then, my friend, do I
        feel this way? Is my despondency reasonable?<br/><br/>
        It is so very difficult to explain a sorrow that has no justification nor reason to be.
        It
        sits behind me, with an invisible but mammoth grasp on my shoulders, whispering and
        pondering the next moments to leak
        all my insecurities into my mannerisms, and excrete poison into my voices.<br/><br/>
        I smile eternally, and look at my life with a somber disappointment. I do not know,
        sometimes, the difference between
        my laughter and my crying.<br/><br/>
