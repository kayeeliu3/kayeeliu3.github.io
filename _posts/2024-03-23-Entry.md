        Boundless, bursting, fracturing the glass that keeps the
        flicker within my body enclosed, and trusting the wind outside
        to fan the flame bright. Splinter the headspace outwards,
        rupture the inside and be reborn. I am my own companion and
        assailant and stranger; the same sky we share, the same oxygen
        inhaled.
        <br /><br />To hold my own hand as I propel myself in an
        unknown trajectory, and tell myself that that's okay. Whether
        I reach the unseen crevices of the universe that may hold
        horror or beauty, or I reach the stars and see the echoes of
        every point in time reflected back at me, or I am tossed into
        the sun to burn back into what I was before I was born; I will
        gladly accept.<br /><br />
