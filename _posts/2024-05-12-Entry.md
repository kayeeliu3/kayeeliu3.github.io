        To be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing.
        <br /><br />
        But it's rather exciting, is it not? It's nice to slow down,
        and keep going with whatever feels right with the little
        knowledge I've accrued. I don't wish to become so blinded by
        one thing that I fail to see every other thing sitting right
        outside my narrow sight. The things so easily missed, the
        sounds so easily filtered out. A family of geese floating
        downstream, a little one clinging tightly to loved ones with a
        smile as bright as a star, a flower that will only bloom in
        this brief window of time. <br /><br />
