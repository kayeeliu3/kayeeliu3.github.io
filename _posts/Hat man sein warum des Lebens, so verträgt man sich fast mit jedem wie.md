Does rationality sadden me? It feels difficult to extract sense under all these webs and tears. What would I gain if I do so, if I am happier as mad and ignorant of life? Does an understanding of the things around me really give me a better sense of myself? This inferiority I feel - it sparkles brightest and at its ugliest when I try to be rational. I can never seem to placate the disappointment of simply being me, when with another. There exists that belief that I have caused more harm than any good I've made, and will continue to do so. There exists that belief that the world will not care if I depart, and that that is a good thing. There exists that belief that if I was given the choice to never have existed at all, then that is the preferable choice. I do not know how to be free. I do not know how to forgive myself. I despise that I was never taught how to do so, and to say that it's okay to not be the best. But I do not wish to cling.

I seek the absurd from Camus, that one should simply embrace this madness of the world, and face it head on despite there potentially no meaning in it all. To "stare at death with passionate attention" - but death does not evoke such passion for me. I do not fear death.

Hobbes said that to fear death should be the most rational and intuitive fear of all, but I cannot find myself believing so. This natural law does not give me any answers.

Aristotle, Plato and Socrates reject self-death, telling me that it is cowardly and in disinterest of the community around me. Is it so wrong to be cowardly? I find no shame in calling myself a coward. 

The compassion of Mencius has given comfort. That there exists such things that a person loves more than life, and loathes more than death. But can I accept such comfort, for such a mad and insignificant person as I?

In the end, philosophy owes me nothing, and is not meant to serve me. For the sake of the people who contradict my beliefs, I will continue to dream of dying, until the dream comes to me.

Now I bury this, but the irrational mad wishes it for it to still exist in a place other than my laptop.
