        Holy shit, I'm actually an idiot and a half. How have I even
        survived this far?
        <br /><br />
        I can't let things stay like this. I don't want my life to be
        a constant cycle of things being okay for a little while
        before collapsing into itself again. I want so much to be at
        peace with myself that I become less at peace. The more useful
        I wish to be, the more power I place in other people's
        viewpoints, and the less secure I feel in myself. The more at
        peace I want to be, the less useful I find myself to other
        people. And I cannot survive in this world without being
        useful in some way.
        <br /><br />
        How can I feel at peace, and yet useful? Am I pursuing the
        wrong path? Is this what I really want to do? What do I even
        want? How can I survive in a way that makes me somewhat
        content whilst in a position to pay the bills? Am I even
        looking at life the right way?
        <br /><br />This site is a mess. I think I'll rewrite it soon.
        Some day.
