Modes are cool. Let me tell you why they are cool.<br/><br/>
So there's the standard major and minor scales used in classical Western musics.
In reality, there's a ton more scales that exist, including the seven modes (corresponding to the seven unique degrees in a scale) that originally developed from Greek music, and used extensively in church music. 
<br/><br/>Here they are, based in the key of C <br/>(toggling scanlines off may help visibility):

With audio, scales in order as above image:

    />

<br/>What's known as the major scale nowadays is the Ionian mode, and the natural minor scale being Aeolian. Locrian tends to be the least used scale due to its tonic triad being diminished, thus not lending itself to easy cadential finishes (i.e. difficult to go back to tonic chord, as it doesn't sound 'complete'.).

Using these modes can open up a wider avenue of interesting phrases. Let us take a simple melody, set in C Ionian:

![First Melody](/assets/misc/yap_modes/simple_melody_first.png "First melody"){: width="400" }

<audio controls class="mb-3">
    <source
    src="../assets/misc/yap_modes/simple_melody_first.mp3"
    type="audio/mpeg"
    />
</audio>

Let's instead make it a natural minor (Aeolian) instead, and slow down the tempo to create a different feel. This is now C minor, the parallel minor of C major.

![Second Melody](/assets/misc/yap_modes/simple_melody_aeolian.png "Second melody"){: width="400" }

<audio controls class="mb-3">

    type="audio/mpeg"
    />
</audio>

Taking this, and raising the second degree (in this case, Db to D) will make it Phrygian - it's a one semitone difference, but is powerful enough to change the atmosphere of the melody.

![Third Melody](/assets/misc/yap_modes/simple_melody_phrygian.png "Third melody"){: width="400" }

<audio controls class="mb-3">

    type="audio/mpeg"
    />
</audio>

Enough faffing about - let's make it more interesting. Let's take our Aeolian, then deviate from that a little, before settling back into Aeolian and then end with a major chord instead of a minor triad (a Tierce de Picardie!). A simple harmony part has also been added, which greatly aids in backing up the melody, as well as being used as a tool to help deviate from the current mode and key.

![Final Melody](/assets/misc/yap_modes/first_half.png "Final melody"){: width="400" }
![Final Melody 2](/assets/misc/yap_modes/second_half.png "Final melody 2"){: width="400" }
<audio controls class="mb-3">
    <source
    src="../assets/misc/yap_modes/simple_full.mp3"
    type="audio/mpeg"
    />
</audio>
